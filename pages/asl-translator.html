  <p> The biggest hurdle for ASL Translator was configuring and training an image recognition model. My team and I went through several versions of our model each time tweaking the training data set so that the model could recognize similar looking handsigns and handsigns in different environments. In the end we were able to achieve an average of 85% confidence by ensuring our training images were of good quality resolution and varied in lighting.</p>
