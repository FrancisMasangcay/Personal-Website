First project in HTML and CSS for a personal webpage.

The goal was to use this opportunity to introduce myself 
to web development while also creating a neat way to showcase 
future projects. 

For me this project in particular was great learning experience for
not only HTML and CSS but also for using popular industry tools
such as VS Code and Git. I learned about how HTML elements, tags, and 
the general structure of a HTML file is coded. And I also learned how CSS 
styles said HTML elements. 

I would say the most interesting part of this project was working with
media quieries and making the webpage responsive and mobile friendly.
Once the main challenge of learning the basics of HTML and CSS was out of
the way, I found that making the project responsive was a good way to elevate 
it. And learning more about media queries allowed for even more stylish and
creative work to be added.
